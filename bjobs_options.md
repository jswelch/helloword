Categories\
filter

Synopsis\
bjobs -A\
Description\
If you specify job arrays with the job array ID, and also specify -A, do
not include the index list with the job array ID.

You can use -w to show the full array specification, if necessary.

-a\
Displays information about jobs in all states, including jobs that
finished recently.

Categories\
state

Synopsis\
bjobs -a\
Description\
The finished jobs that -a displays are those that finished within an
interval specified by CLEAN_PERIOD in lsb.params (the default period is
1 hour).

Use -a with -x option to display all jobs that have triggered a job
exception (overrun, underrun, idle).

Examples\
bjobs -u all -a

Displays all jobs of all users.

-aff\
Displays information about jobs with CPU and memory affinity resource
requirements for each task in the job.

Categories\
filter, format

Synopsis\
bjobs -l \| -UF \[-aff\]\
Conflicting options\
Use only with the -l or -UF option.

Description\
If the job is pending, the requested affinity resources are displayed.
For running jobs, the effective and combined affinity resource
allocation decision made by LSF is also displayed, along with a table
headed AFFINITY that shows detailed memory and CPU binding information
for each task, one line for each allocated processor unit. For finished
jobs (EXIT or DONE state), the affinity requirements for the job, and
the effective and combined affinity resource requirement details are
displayed.

Use bhist -l -aff to show the actual affinity resource allocation for
finished jobs.

-app\
Displays information about jobs submitted to the specified application
profile.

Categories\
filter

Synopsis\
bjobs -app application_profile_name\
Description\
You must specify an existing application profile.

Examples\
bjobs -app fluent

Displays all jobs belonging to the application profile fluent.

-aps\
Displays absolute priority scheduling (APS) information for pending jobs
in a queue with APS_PRIORITY enabled.

Categories\
format

Synopsis\
bjobs -aps\
Description\
The APS value is calculated based on the current scheduling cycle, so
jobs are not guaranteed to be dispatched in this order.

Pending jobs are ordered by APS value. Jobs with system APS values are
listed first, from highest to lowest APS value. Jobs with calculated APS
values are listed next ordered from high to low value. Finally, jobs not
in an APS queue are listed. Jobs with equal APS values are listed in
order of submission time. APS values of jobs not in an APS queue are
shown with a dash (-).

If queues are configured with the same priority, bjobs -aps may not show
jobs in the correct expected dispatch order. Jobs may be dispatched in
the order the queues are configured in lsb.queues. You should avoid
configuring queues with the same priority.

For resizable jobs, -aps displays the latest APS information for running
jobs with active resize allocation requests. LSF handles the dynamic
priority for running jobs with active resize requests. The displayed job
priority can change from time to time.

-d\
Displays information about jobs that finished recently.

Categories\
state

Synopsis\
bjobs -d\
Description\
The finished jobs that -d displays are those that finished within an
interval specified by CLEAN_PERIOD in lsb.params (the default period is
1 hour).

Examples\
bjobs -d -q short -m hostA -u user1

Displays all the recently finished jobs submitted by user1 to the queue
short, and executed on the host hostA.

-data\
Last Updated: 2024-01-08\
Displays the data file requirements for the job. The -data option acts
as a filter to show only jobs with data requirements. For example, the
option lists jobs that are submitted with -data. The option also lists
files or data requirement tags that are requested by the job.

Categories\
filter

Synopsis\
bjobs -data \[jobID\]\
Conflicting options\
Do not use the -data option with the following options: -A, -sum.

Description\
The following units are displayed for file size:\
nnn B if file size is less than 1 KB\
nnn\[.n\] KB if file size is less than 1 MB\
nnn\[.n\] MB if file size is less than 1 GB\
nnn\[.n\] GB if file size is 1 GB or larger\
nnn\[.n\] EB if file size is 1 EB or larger\
A dash (-) indicates that a size or modification time stamp value is not
available.

For jobs with data requirements that are specified as tags, the -data
option shows the tag names.

Examples\
bjobs -data 1962\
JOBID USER STAT QUEUE FROM_HOST EXEC_HOST JOB_NAME SUBMIT_TIME\
1962 user1 PEND normal hostA \*p 1000000 Sep 20 16:31\

1962 user1 PEND normal hostA \*p 1000000 Sep 20 16:31\
TAG\
OUTPUT_FROM_J1\
OUTPUT_FROM_J2

For jobs with a folder as data requirement, the -data shows the folder
name. Individual files in the folder are not shown. For example, for the
following data requirement\
bsub -data "/home/user/folder1/" myjob

the -data option shows the folder name /home/user/folder1/:\
bjobs -data 44843\
JOBID USER STAT QUEUE FROM_HOST EXEC_HOST JOB_NAME SUBMIT_TIME\
44843 user1 PEND normal hosta myjob May 10 14:42

FILE SIZE MODIFIED\

-env\
Last Updated: 2024-01-08\
Displays the environment variables in the job submission environment for
the specified job.

Categories\
filter

Synopsis\
bjobs -env\
Conflicting options\
Do not use with any other bjobs command options.

Description\
You must specify a single job ID or job array element ID when using the
-env command option. Multiple job IDs are not supported.

When using the LSF multicluster capability and a lease job contains
application-specific environment variables, the -env command option
cannot display these application-specific environment variables when
issued from the remote cluster.

-fwd\

display information on forwarded jobs.

Categories\
filter

Synopsis\
bjobs -fwd\
Conflicting options\
Do not use with the following options: -A, -d, -sla, -ss, -x.

Description\
In LSF multicluster capability job forwarding mode, filters output to
display information on forwarded jobs, including the forwarded time and
the name of the cluster to which the job was forwarded. -fwd can be used
with other options to further filter the results. For example, bjobs
-fwd -r displays only forwarded running jobs.

To use -x to see exceptions on the execution cluster, use bjobs -m
execution_cluster -x.

Examples\
% bjobs -fwd\
JOBID USER STAT QUEUE EXEC_HOST JOB_NAME CLUSTER FORWARD_TIME\
123 lsfuser RUN queue1 hostC sleep 1234 cluster3 Nov 29 14:08

-G\

Displays jobs associated with the specified user group.

Categories\
filter

Synopsis\
bjobs -G user_group\
Conflicting options\
Do not use with the -u option.

Description\
Only displays jobs associated with a user group submitted with bsub -G
for the specified user group. The --G option does not display jobs from
subgroups within the specified user group. Jobs associated with the user
group at submission are displayed, even if they are later switched to a
different user group.

You can only specify a user group name. The keyword all is not supported
for -G.

-g\
Last Updated: 2024-01-08\
Displays information about jobs attached to the specified job group.

Categories\
filter

Synopsis\
bjobs -g job_group_name\
Description\
Use -g with -sla to display job groups attached to a time-based service
class. Once a job group is attached to a time-based service class, all
jobs submitted to that group are subject to the SLA.

bjobs -l with -g displays the full path to the group to which a job is
attached.

Examples\
bjobs -g /risk_group\
JOBID USER STAT QUEUE FROM_HOST EXEC_HOST JOB_NAME SUBMIT_TIME\
113 user1 PEND normal hostA myjob Jun 17 16:15\
111 user2 RUN normal hostA hostA myjob Jun 14 15:13\
110 user1 RUN normal hostB hostA myjob Jun 12 05:03\
104 user3 RUN normal hostA hostC myjob Jun 11 13:18

To display the full path to the group to which a job is attached, run
bjobs -l -g:

bjobs -l -g /risk_group\
Job \<101\>, User `<user1>`{=html}, Project

<default>

...

-gpu\
bjobs -l -gpu shows the following information on GPU job allocation:

Categories\
filter

Synopsis\
bjobs -l \| -UF \[-gpu\]\
Conflicting options\
Use only with the -l or -UF option.

Description\
Host Name\
The name of the host.\
GPU IDs on the host\
Each GPU is shown as a separate line.\
TASK and ID\
List of job tasks and IDs using the GPU (separated by comma if used by
multiple tasks)\
MODEL\
Contains the GPU brand name and model type name.\
MTOTAL\
The total GPU memory size.\
GPU Compute Capability\
MRSV\
GPU memory reserved by the job\
SOCKET\
socket ID of the GPU located at\
NVLINK\
Indicates if the GPU has NVLink connections with other GPUs allocated
for the job (ranked by GPU ID and including itself). The connection flag
of each GPU is a character separated by "/" with the next GPU:\
A "Y" indicates there is a direct NVLINK connection between two GPUs.\
An "N" shows there is no direct NVLINK connection with that GPU.\
A "-" shows the GPU is itself.\
If the job exited abnormally due to a GPU-related error or warning, the
error or warning message displays. If LSF could not get GPU usage
information from DCGM, a hyphen (-) displays.

-hms\
Displays times in the customized output in hh:mm:ss format.

Categories\
format

Synopsis\
bjobs -o format \[-json\] -hms\
Conflicting options\
Use only with the -o and -o -json options.

Description\
When specified, bjobs displays any times (but not time stamps) in the
customized output in hh:mm:ss format.

The cpu_used field normally uses one decimal place in the bjobs output,
but if you specify -hms, bjobs rounds up this field to the next second.
For example, if the cpu_used field is 0.2 seconds, specifying -hms
rounds this number up to 00:00:01.

For the runtimelimit field, if the ABS_RUNLIMIT parameter is defined as
Y in the lsb.params file and you specify -hms, bjobs does not display
the host name. That is, if ABS_RUNLIMIT=Y is defined in the lsb.params
file, bjobs normally displays the host name after the runtime limit (for
example, 3.0/hostA). If you specify -hms, bjobs displays the runtime
limit without the host name (for example, 00:03:00). This also applies
if the ABS_RUNLIMIT parameter is defined as Y in the lsb.applications
file and you specify -hms to a job that is submitted to an application
profile with ABS_RUNLIMIT=Y.

Specifying the -hms option overrides the LSB_HMS_TIME_FORMAT environment
variable, which overrides the LSB_HMS_TIME_FORMAT parameter setting in
the lsf.conf file.

This option applies only to output for the bjobs -o and bjobs -o -json
commands for customized output. This option has no effect when run with
bjobs without the -o option.

-hostfile\
Last Updated: 2024-01-08\
Displays information about a job submitted with a user-specified host
file.

Categories\
format

Synopsis\
bjobs -l \| -UF \[-hostfile\]\
Conflicting options\
Use only with the -l or -UF option.

Description\
If a job was submitted with bsub -hostfile or modified with bmod
-hostfile to point to a user-specified host file, use -hostfile to show
the user-specified host file path as well as the contents of the host
file.

Use -hostfile together with -l or -UF, to view the user specified host
file content as well as the host allocation for a given job.

Example\
Use -l -hostfile to display a user-specified host file that was
submitted with a job or added to a job.

For example:\
bjobs -l -hostfile 2012\
Job \<2012\>, User `<userG>`{=html}, Project `<myproject>`{=html},
Status `<PEND>`{=html}, Queue\
`<normal>`{=html}, Commnad \<sleep 10000\>\
Thu Aug 1 12:43:25: Submitted from host `<host10a>`{=html},\
CWD \<\$HOME\>,Host file `</home/userG/myhostfile>`{=html};

......

USER-SPECIFIED HOST FILE:\
HOST SLOTS\
host01 3\
host02 1\
host01 1\
host02 2\
host03 1

-J\
Displays information about jobs or job arrays with the specified job
name.

Categories\
filter

Synopsis\
bjobs -J job_name\
Description\
Only displays jobs that were submitted by the user running this command.

The job name can be up to 4094 characters long. Job names are not
unique.

The wildcard character (**) can be used anywhere within a job name, but
cannot appear within array indices. For example job** returns jobA and
jobarray\[1\], **AAA**\[1\] returns the first element in all job arrays
with names containing AAA, however job1\[\*\] will not return anything
since the wildcard is within the array index.
